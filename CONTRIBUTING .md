# How to contribute

If you find any bugs or would like to see new features, please file an issue here on GitHub or - even better - send a pull request.

Please use the "develop" branch for contributing, as I use [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
(I know, that's pushing it a bit, but I try to learn sth. on developing this).

You'll need [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) for development. Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then just run `npm i` from the project root directory to install Gulp and all required plugins.
Afterwards you can execute `gulp` from the project root directory to let Gulp watch for changes and automatically recompile artifacts (CSS/JS/...) as needed.
